Prior to submitting an agency protest, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve your concerns with the responsible contracting officer (Phone: (315)772-5582 or Email: usarmy.drum.acc-micc.mbx.micc@army.mil). However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Ensure Compliance: Make sure your proposal complies with all submission requirements, including format, deadlines, and documentation. Technical Support: If you encounter any issues, PIEE has support resources available, including help desks and user guides.

Justification and approval of use of brand name or equal purchase description. The use of Brand Name or Equal in this solicitation is approved because the solicitation includes, in addition to the brand name, a general description of those salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the brand name item that an "equal" item must meet to be acceptable for award. If an offeror does not meet a salient characteristic that is not listed in the solicitation for the brand name, the Government will not use that to disqualify the offer. Only the listed salient characteristics will be used to determine an offeror acceptable or unacceptable. The salient characteristics are firm requirements of the Government and are not proprietary specifications or standards. Since, none of the listed salient characteristics are proprietary and only those listed will be used to determine an offer acceptable, it is determined that the use of brand name or equal will not limit competition to any brand that will meet the firm requirements of the Government. There is no Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) assigned rating for this acquisition. Quotes are due by the date and time listed in the PIEE solicitation module and must be submitted in the PIEE solicitation module.
