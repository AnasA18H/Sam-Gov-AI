If a PR is evaluated manually, quoting ranges provides the buyer the option to combine requirements or reduce the quantity as needed without resoliciting or adding any additional administrative burden for either party involved when making an award. This does not apply to Auto IDC. If you anticipate quoting on a solicitation after the closing date, please submit a DIBBS quote with a bid type of No Bid and place an anticipated quote date or the reason you are not willing to quote. This does not prevent you from submitting an actual quote on DIBBS at a later date. It will overlay your previous no quote. This informs buyers of your intention to quote and prevents multiple calls for updates and cancelling of requirements assumed to be non-procurable due to no quotes/sources. The submission of an anticipated quote date does not preclude DLA from making an award to another acceptable timely offer.

"U.S.-flag vessel" means either a vessel belonging to the United States or a vessel of the United States as that term is defined in 46 U.S.C. 116.

(d) The Contractor and its subcontractors may request, via the Contracting Officer, a waiver of the requirement to use a U.S.-flag vessel, or identification of any available U.S.-flag vessels, if the Contractor or a subcontractor sufficiently explains that -- (1) U.S.-flag vessels are not available at a fair and reasonable rate for commercial vessels of the United States; or (2) U.S.-flag vessels are otherwise not available. (e) The Contractor must submit any request for use of foreign-flag vessels in writing to the Contracting Officer at least 45 days prior to the sailing date necessary to meet its delivery schedules. The Contracting Officer will process requests submitted after such date(s) as expeditiously as possible, however, if a DoD waiver is not approved prior to the shipper's sailing date, this will not of itself constitute a compensable delay under this or any other clause of this contract.
