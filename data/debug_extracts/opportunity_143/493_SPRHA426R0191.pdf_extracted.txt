(c) The Contracting Officer will consider SPRS risk assessments during the evaluation of quotations or offers received in response to this solicitation as follows: (1) Item risk will be considered to determine whether the procurement represents a high performance risk to the Government. (2) Price risk will be considered in determining if a proposed price is consistent with historical prices paid for a product or a service or otherwise createsa risk to the Government. (3) Supplier risk, including but not limited to quality and delivery, will be considered to assess the risk of unsuccessful performance and supply chain risk. (d) SPRS risk assessments are generated daily. Quoters or Offerors are able to access their risk assessments by following the access instructions in the SPRS users guide available at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/reference.htm. Quoters and Offerors are granted access to SPRS for their own risk assessment classifications only. SPRS reporting procedures and risk assessment methodology are detailed in the SPRS users guide.
