Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment Vendor Registration Guide A vendor portal for solicitations was introduced as an enterprise-level service for the Department of Defense (DoD) within the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) platform. This capability allows DoD to have a more automated and secure process for capturing solicitations and their attachments and responses from industry. There are two vendor roles (Proposal Manager, Proposal View Only) for the PIEE Solicitation Module. The Proposal Manager role is required to submit an offer to a solicitation posted in the PIEE Solicitation Module. In this guide, you will find step by step by step instructions for new users to self-register for a PIEE user account and existing users to add additional roles. Refer to the Roles and Actions/Functions Matrix, in the help section, to assist with determining which PIEE Solicitation Module role you will need to add. Guide Contents Page 1 of 7
